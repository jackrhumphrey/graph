# Graph project

[Link](https://jackrhumphrey.github.io/graph)

A tool to model musical structures through group actions in graph theory 

1. The tool can be used to visualise musical chords via a graph structure
1. The 12 nodes represent the 12 notes of the chromatic scale. The starting note can be changed by using the Key dropdown
2. The tool can be interacted with by clicking on a node to add or remove it from the chord
3. The inversion buttons can be used to toggle the lowest note of the chord
4. The chord can be transposed by clicking the left or right transpose buttons, represented by a rotation about the graph
4. Notes can be constrained to a scale by using the Scale dropdown. This works with transposition
5. When switching from one scale to another, notes will conform to the new scale. Note this only works between two seven note scales
6. Users can also define a custom scale by clicking Edit beside the Key dropdown, or by selecting Custom to start from scratch
7. Users can save a configuration by pressing the Save button. The current image will be populated under the controls. The chord can then be loaded by clicking on the image. All information about the state of the program will be retained
8. The sound can be played by pressing the play button
