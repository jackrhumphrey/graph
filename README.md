# Graph project

A tool to model musical structures through group actions in graph theory 

1. The tool can be used to visualise musical chords via a graph structure
1. The 12 nodes represent the 12 notes of the chromatic scale. The starting note can be changed by using the Key dropdown
2. The tool can be interacted with by clicking on a node to add or remove it from the chord
3. The inversion buttons can be used to toggle the lowest note of the chord
4. The chord can be transposed by clicking the left and right transpose buttons, represented by a rotation around the graph
4. Notes can be constrained to a scale by using the Scale dropdown. This works with transpotion
